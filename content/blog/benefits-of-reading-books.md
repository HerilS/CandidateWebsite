In the 11th century, a Japanese woman known as Murasaki Shikibu wrote “The Tale of Genji,” a 54-chapter story of courtly seduction believed to be the world’s first novel.

Nearly 2,000 years later, people the world over are still engrossed by novels — even in an era where stories appear on handheld screens and disappear 24 hours later.

What exactly do human beings get from reading books? Is it just a matter of pleasure, or are there benefits beyond enjoyment? The scientific answer is a resounding “yes.”

Reading books benefits both your [physical](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise) and [mental health](https://www.healthline.com/health/emotional-health), and those benefits can last a lifetime. They begin in early childhood and continue through the senior years. Here’s a brief explanation of how reading books can change your brain — and your body — for the better.

# Reading Strengthens The Brain

A growing body of research indicates that reading literally changes your mind.

Using [MRI scans](https://www.healthline.com/health/head-mri), researchers have [confirmed Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4128180/) that reading involves a complex network of circuits and signals in the brain. As your reading ability matures, those networks also get stronger and more sophisticated.

In one [studyTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3868356/) conducted in 2013, researchers used functional MRI scans to measure the effect of reading a novel on the brain. Study participants read the novel “Pompeii” over a period of 9 days. As tension built in the story, more and more areas of the brain lit up with activity.

Brain scans showed that throughout the reading period and for days afterward, brain connectivity increased, especially in the [somatosensory cortex](https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/parietal-lobe), the part of the brain that responds to physical sensations like movement and pain.
